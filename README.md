This is a random character generator for Cyberpunk 2020 pen and paper RPG. It is a work in 
progress. Goal is to learn about writing and ultimately distributing software.

There are several versions, as I have been working on the same project in multiple
languages to see it how it goes. I will be pursuing the python version for now,
and hope to have more features such as equipment and name generation, 
perhaps a gui version.
