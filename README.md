This is a project is a collection of utilities for various board and tabletop games.

First is a random character generator for Cyberpunk 2020 pen and paper RPG. It is a work in progress. I intend to add more role playing games to the same script, such as D&D. My goal is to learn about writing and ultimately distributing software.

Second is a warband generator for the game Frostgrave. I wrote a test version in Go first, but did not think the project warranted that language, so I am rewriting in Python. I will keep the old version in the repo for reference for now.
